scene interviewtwo with Dissolve(1)

G "Name?"
r "Ryuka Malum."
G "Oh. It is not only in my head then. I do know you."
r "...Hm? Where from... sir?"
G "Ryutaro Malum was a good friend of mine. I was there when you were born, and a handful of other events."
G "We've been in the modern art museum together a few times."
r "Oh... apologies, I dont... remember you."
G "That is excusable. I cannot recall even my cherished teen ages any longer."

r "Is it not a test?"
G "It is a test, but one would be hard pressed to meet failure."
G "We will determine your role based on the answers presented hereafter. Think carefully, and let not thy honesty be swayed by pride."
G "The consequences could... or rather, would be dire."
r "Right."
G "First..."
"My unimpressive display of readiness to complete these tasks must've left him disappointed in some way."
"Surely the daughter of Ryutaro would bring forth a righteous performance in this almost familiar ambient."
G "Lastly..."

G "Draw me a tree."
r "Huh?"
"At this point, this is more than just the weight of an official- the commander is staring into my eyes, unwavering, unnerving."
"My skin crawls at the sight."
"What kind of question is this? What do trees have to do with any of this?"
"It might be some kind of deep psychological test. If I had been in the discussions of art with my dad and brother, I might've been able to have a better grip on what is going on."
"But I was too young to care."
"Was I? How old is appropriate for a girl to care?"
"I should've been, it was about my dad. I should've..."
"I should've spent the time we had together better."
"I dont have that anymore."
"I want to go back."
"...Blanken the mind and draw, shithead."
"Focus. Focus."

"Unhewn lines come and go, bestowing the paper its uncanny purpose."
"I turn in the drawing. The sheet reels towards the man."
"Wait... perhaps what just passed was a proxy, a misdirection, and the true test is to measure the confidence and or quality of the product and student. The attitude."
"Eeerm, far too late to rectify any possible wrongdoings..."

G "Very well, Ryuka. Sublime."
r "Th... thank you, sir."
G "I have the results of your test."
G "You are to be the commander of a crew of five. Your role is to observe the battlefield and coordinate your four colleagues in action."
G "Think of them not as pawns, but limbs. The tank is a body of sorts. Do not flaggelate this second self, yet, do not treat it to sloth or meager gain."
G "Though I should warn you, just as one dont think and command one's own arm to parry a blow, or catch a falling object your crew also has its own mind. Overextension is scarcely met with responsiveness. One thinks not to walk, the legs themselves do it."
G "You must be effective without being descructive."
G "Your platoon number and crew will be arranged for you soon."
G "The enemy will unlikely be so bold as to strike now, still it is the coastliners duty to be ready at all times."
G "That is all for now."
G "It was nice to see you again, Ryuka."
G "Dismissed."
r "Sir."

"Nevermind the creepyness of it, that was the oddest of remarks coming from this particular unit. I expected to be recognized, but not to meet this kind of... favoritism?"
"Commander of a crew..."
"Of all roles..."
